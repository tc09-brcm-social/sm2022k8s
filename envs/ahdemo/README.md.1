Procedure to set it up
* configure the <<home>>>/env.shlib to pick the Cloud Provider
	* for example the CLOUD is set to gcp when using Google
* configure the cluster/<<CLOUD>>/env.shlib to set proper
	* Cloud Provider details including number of worker nodes
	* for example, AuthHub can take as many as 5 worker nodes

	* MINNODES=3
	* MAXNODES=6
* cd <<home>>/envs/ahdemo
* bash make.sh # to set environement variables
* cd <<home>>/cluster
